NAME: gitlab
LAST DEPLOYED: Sat Oct  7 04:25:06 2023
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
=== CRITICAL
The following charts are included for evaluation purposes only. They will not be supported by GitLab Support
for production workloads. Use Cloud Native Hybrid deployments for production. For more information visit
https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/index.html#use-the-reference-architectures.
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Gitaly
- MinIO

=== NOTICE
The minimum required version of PostgreSQL is now 13. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/installation/upgrade.md for more details.

=== NOTICE
You've installed GitLab Runner without the ability to use 'docker in docker'.
The GitLab Runner chart (gitlab/gitlab-runner) is deployed without the `privileged` flag by default for security purposes. This can be changed by setting `gitlab-runner.runners.privileged` to `true`. Before doing so, please read the GitLab Runner chart's documentation on why we
chose not to enable this by default. See https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes.html#running-docker-in-docker-containers-with-gitlab-runners
Help us improve the installation experience, let us know how we did with a 1 minute survey:https://gitlab.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6kVqZANThUQ1bZb?installation=helm&release=16-4

=== NOTICE
The in-chart NGINX Ingress Controller has the following requirements:
    - Kubernetes version must be 1.20 or newer (unless NGINX version is set
      to v1.2.1 via `nginx-ingress.controller.image.tag=v1.2.1`, which will
      restore Kubernetes 1.19 compatibility).
    - Ingress objects must be in group/version `networking.k8s.io/v1`.
